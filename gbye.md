It's not a see you later, it's a goodbye.


Dear everyone in this server,

I hope this message finds each of you well. It is with a heavy heart that I write this letter to inform you of my decision to leave Discord. This is not a decision I have made lightly, and I want to take a moment to express my thoughts and feelings as I bid farewell to this community.

First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to each and every one of you. Being a part of this Discord community has been an incredible journey filled with laughter, support, and camaraderie. From late-night gaming sessions to deep conversations about shared interests, the memories weve created together will forever hold a special place in my heart.

However, as life evolves, so do our priorities and commitments. After much reflection, I have come to the realization that I need to redirect my focus and energy towards other aspects of my life. While it saddens me to step away from this vibrant community, I know that it is the right decision for me at this time.

Please know that my decision to leave Discord is in no way a reflection of my feelings towards any of you. On the contrary, I have formed genuine connections and friendships here that I will always cherish. I am immensely grateful for the support, kindness, and understanding that each of you has shown me throughout my time here.

As I embark on this new chapter of my journey, I want to extend my best wishes to all of you. May your adventures on Discord continue to be filled with joy, laughter, and meaningful connections. I have no doubt that this community will thrive in my absence, and I look forward to hearing about all the wonderful things you will accomplish together.

While I may be leaving Discord, please know that I am not disappearing entirely. I value each of you deeply, and I am only a message away if you ever want to reconnect or catch up. My door is always open, and I would love nothing more than to stay in touch with each of you.

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for the incredible memories and experiences weve shared on Discord. Though I may be saying goodbye for now, please know that you will always hold a special place in my thoughts and memories.

With warm regards and heartfelt gratitude,
Chloe.
